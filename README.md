OpenGl practice and project for University of Miskolc.

## The Project
A mini-golf demo game. Enjoy shooting the ball around the map, while enjoying cherry blossoms falling.

 - Camera centered around the ball or by pressing <kbd>c</kbd> to switch to free-cam mode.
 - You can make the ball glow (or not) by pressing the <kbd>f</kbd>.
 - Shoot the ball by holding down <kbd>LMB</kbd> (left mouse button) then moving the mouse to set the power and releasing it!
 - An in-game help with <kbd>F1</kbd>.
 - Cherry blossoms for atmosphere via a particle system.
 - A nice and simple collision and gravity system.
 - A GUI to show how to reach in-game help and the power bar for how strong the ball will be hit.
 - A basic map to explore the demo game's capabilities.
 - A golf hole, in which the ball goes, the ball gets reset, and a celebration is shown.
 - Counter for number of hits. Try to get par!
